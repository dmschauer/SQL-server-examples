# SQL-server-examples

This repository is meant to showcase some examples of work done in the SQL Server ecosystem. That is
- SSDT: SQL Server Data Tools / database objects
- SSIS: Integration Services / ETL workflows
- SSRS: Reportings Services

Everything inside it was generated in Visual Studio 2019 with the exception of the database objects which I created directly in SSMS.
